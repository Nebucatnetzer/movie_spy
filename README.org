* movie_spy

Movie Spy Is a program to quickly collect all personal information
from a computer. Ideally run from a live USB stick. The name comes
from the fact that in movies spies can just quickly insert a USB key
and get all the important data.

As of now it doesn't start automatically when you plug in an USB
stick. In fact this program was mostly developed as a fun project
for myself and is not really intended to be used seriously.

Usage:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
moviespy <source> <destination>
moviespy (-h | --help)
moviespy --version
#+END_SRC

Options:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
-h --help     Show this screen.
--version     Show version.
#+END_SRC

** Planned features

- As of now the program just overwrites files with the same name. I
  would like to insert a check if the files are the same and when they
  aren't the same append a an increasing number. This way less files
  should get lost.
